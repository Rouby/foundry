They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"43\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Artificers in Many Worlds</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Throughout the D&amp;D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war.

You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB,4\">chapter 5</a>, \"Equipment,\" in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> for descriptions of these tools.</p><p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"56\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Magic of Artifice</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast @spell[cure wounds] using @item[alchemist's supplies|PHB], you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using @item[tinker's tools|PHB], you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast @spell[poison spray], you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p><p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace @spell[cure wounds] with @spell[heat metal], you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p><p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"57\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1,flstclass:artificer=1\">artificer spell list</a>.

With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell @spell[cure wounds], you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p><p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.</p><p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p><p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"45\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sworn and Beholden</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.</p><p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"46\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Delvers into Secrets</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p><p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p><p>Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"47\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Warlock</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?</p><p>Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character's adventuring career. Your patron's demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.</p><p>What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron's plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?</p><p>How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron's voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds—messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"48\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions.

Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks.

Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"68\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rogue</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law.

The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p><p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"20\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Learning from Experience</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p><p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"21\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Bard</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character's background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There's no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.</p><p>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"22\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.

To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell).

Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.

To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h3>Spellbook</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1stlevel wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Level</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Cantrips Known</td>\n<td colspan=\"9\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.

You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h3>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h3>\n<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Level</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Cantrips Known</td>\n<td colspan=\"9\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.</p><p>@ActorEmbeddedItem[xk7LwfFw6bE8w7Y0][Illusion Savant]</p><p>@ActorEmbeddedItem[xk7LwfFw6bE8w7Y0][Improved Minor Illusion]</p></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":null},"consume":{"type":null,"target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"requirements":"Wizard 2 (Illusion)","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"classfeatures.html","source":"PHB","hash":"school%20of%20illusion_wizard_phb_illusion_phb_2_phb"}}},{"_id":"VuX0ib9llFc4dTPZ","name":"Illusion Savant","type":"feat","img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/mighty-force.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.</p></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":null},"consume":{"type":null,"target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"requirements":"Wizard 2 (Illusion)","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"classfeatures.html","source":"PHB","hash":"illusion%20savant_wizard_phb_illusion_phb_2_phb"}}},{"_id":"RNKvhBY9VIVM0cG0","name":"Improved Minor Illusion","type":"feat","img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/mighty-force.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the @spell[minor illusion] cantrip.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":6,"subclass":"School of Illusion","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"srd5e":{"sourceSubclass":"PHB","hashSubclass":"wizard_phb,state:sub-illusion-phb=b1"}}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Level</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Cantrips Known</td>\n<td colspan=\"9\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.
