As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms.

They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p><p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p><p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p><p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"11\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giant Gods</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p><p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.</p><p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie.

However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"15\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Demon Summoning.</span></span> <p>Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to another's will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"16\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bound Demons.</span></span> <p>The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Iggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the fiend's return to the Abyss.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"17\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Demonic Possession.</span></span> <p>No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"18\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Demon Lords</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The chaotic power of the Abyss rewards demons of particular ruthlessness and ingenuity with a dark blessing, transforming them into unique fiends whose power can rival the gods.

The elven goddess Lolth became a demon lord after Corellon Larethian cast her into the Abyss for betraying elvenkind.

These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.</p><p>With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p><p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"64\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Brutal and Cruel.</span></span> <p>All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature.

On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"65\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Foes and Servants.</span></span> <p>Black dragons hate and fear other dragons.

A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"68\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chromatic Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind.

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"70\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"71\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p><p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"72\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Queen of Evil Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p><p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p><p>Dragon Age Categories</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Category</th><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Size</th><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Age Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Wyrmling</td><td class=\"col-4\">Medium</td><td class=\"col-4\">5 years or less</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Young</td><td class=\"col-4\">Large</td><td class=\"col-4\">6–100 years</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Adult</td><td class=\"col-4\">Huge</td><td class=\"col-4\">101–800 years</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Ancient</td><td class=\"col-4\">Gargantuan</td><td class=\"col-4\">801 years or more</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \" data-source=\"FTD\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"59\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Customizing Dragons</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons\">FTD</span> p33</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>You can customize any dragon's stat block to reflect the dragon's unique character.

A war chief so blessed finds that his weapons cut deeper into his enemies, allowing him to inflict more carnage.</p><p>King Obould Many-Arrows</p><p>King Obould of the Many-Arrows tribe is a legend among the orc war chiefs of the Forgotten Realms, and he is the most famous orc chief in the history of the D&amp;D game.</p><p>Smarter and more intuitive than most of his kind, Obould slew his chieftain to take control of his tribe. Skilled in the arts of war and renowned for his violent temper, Obould proved himself a fierce opponent in battle time and again. Over the years, he subsumed other orc tribes into his own, until he commanded a horde of thousands.</p><p>Obould leveraged his strength and influence to carve out a kingdom for himself in the Spine of the World, a mountain range overlooking numerous dwarven, human, and elven strongholds.</p><p>After years of bloody conflict with his more civilized neighbors, Obould did the unthinkable and brokered a peace treaty with his enemies. This treaty confused many of the orcs under Obould's command. It was either a clever ploy by Obould to buy time while he strengthened his army for a final, decisive sweep across the Savage Frontier, or it was a troubling sign that Obould had forsaken the ways of Gruumsh and needed to be destroyed.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"30\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Orcs.</span></span> <p>Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"31\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gruumsh One-Eye.</span></span> <p> Orcs worship Gruumsh, the mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"32\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tribes like Plagues.</span></span> <p>Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.</p><p>On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.</p><p>Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"33\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ranging Scavengers.</span></span> <p> Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"34\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leadership and Might.</span></span> <p> Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"35\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Orc Crossbreeds.</span></span> <p> Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic evil","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"orc","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Arctic, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark","cr":4,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1100},"source":"MM","class":{},"gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","orc"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"aVyfPdFKbLCXovy6":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Orc War Chief","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"monks-tokenbar":{"include":"default"},"patrol":{"enablePatrol":false,"enableSpotting":false,"makePatroller":false,"multiPath":false,"patrolPathName":"","pathNodeIndex":"0"},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"chatbubble":""},"environment-interaction":{"environmentToken":false},"core":{}},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/MM/Orc War Chief.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1663501974035,"lastModifiedBy":"aVyfPdFKbLCXovy6"}}

They have grown to monstrous proportions and have learned to make the terrain an ally in their hunts.</p><p>Lore</p><p>Natural loners, the spiders of the Tablelands haunt shallow caves, deep valleys, and similar locations that offer cramped confines and twisting passages. The spiders weave webs across these passages. In some instances, they spin their webs over great pits or across chasms.</p><p>Encounters</p><p>Athas's spiders regard other creatures as food, and they establish lairs in territory through which easy prey passes. They prefer areas that see regular travel, steering clear of high-traffic routes to avoid unwanted attention. A spider's lair usually contains three to five webs stretched across its major passages.</p><p>Black Spiders</p><p>Rearing itself up before you is an enormous spider the size of a man with disgusting, oily black skin, mottled with lurid red and purple streaks. Its features are almost humanoid and it regards you with a menacing leer.</p><p>Dark spiders are an intelligent species of subterranean arachnid that lives in highly organized tribal units. Divided among warriors, defilers and queens, they have no natural enemies but often create enemies through their predatory behavior when nesting young. Dark spiders stand six feet in height and weigh 120 pounds, although their queens reach twice that size when mature. The more intelligent among them are able to master humanoid tongues, and some have been known to trade silk to merchant houses in return for warm-blooded slaves.</p><p>Dark spiders prefer to either strike from ambush, using their webbing, or attack with greater numbers and overwhelm their foes. Warbands of warrior spiders are often led by individual defilers or psions, who use their powers to bolster the melee attacks of the warriors. In melee, dark spiders strike with two claws and a poisonous bite. The venom of the queen is particularly potent and is easily capable of killing an adult human. The poison of the other dark spiders is still dangerous but less routinely fatal than that of the queens.</p><p>Info</p><p>A top dark spider society sit the queens. Each tribe has its own queen, and each queen boasts the powers of a full defiler as well as strength in excess of that of the mightiest warriors. The queens lay their young in web sacs at the heart of their nests, where they are defended by elite bands of warriors and defiler/psions. Dark spider poison is greatly prized by assassins, and the wily creatures are not above trading their venom for warm meat for their young.</p>","public":""},"alignment":"unaligned","race":"","type":{"value":"aberration","subtype":"spider","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Desert, Mountain,

Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p><p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale.

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"35\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"36\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure.

A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"37\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Queen of Evil Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p><p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.

that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p><p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p><p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p><p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"150\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Cause of Righteousness</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p><p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"151\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beyond the Mundane Life</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p><p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"152\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Paladin</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.</p><p>How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.</p><p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals.

Traditional smithies occupy places of honor in their demesnes, and the giants' stony fortresses constantly belch plumes of sooty smoke.

Though fire giants are skilled in the engineering of mine tunnels and the gathering of ore, they place less importance on the safety of their slaves than on smelting and working the bounty those slaves produce.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"42\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Skilled Artisans.</span></span> <p>Fire giants have a fearsome reputation as soldiers and conquerors, and for their ability to burn, plunder, and destroy.

As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms.

They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p><p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p><p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p><p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"46\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giant Gods</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p><p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.</p><p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie.

These frog-headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for easier prey.</p><p>Bullywugs have green, gray, or mottled yellow skin that shifts through shades of gray, green, and brown, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings.

They follow an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their leader-a self-styled lord of the muck. Bullywugs introduce themselves with grand-sounding titles, make great shows of bowing and debasing themselves before their superiors, and endlessly vie to win their superiors' favor.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind. It can either murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its criminal deeds secret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it's more common for bullywugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their good graces. Invariably, such fine goods are reduced to filthy tatters through abuse and neglect. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Unruly Diplomacy.</span></span> <p>Bullywugs love nothing more than lording over those who trespass on their territories.

Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before it tries to impress its \"guests\" with the majesty of its treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect of outsiders.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Amphibian Allies.</span></span> <p>Bullywugs speak a language that allows them to communicate over large areas by croaking like frogs.

They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"43\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Artificers in Many Worlds</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Throughout the D&amp;D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war.

The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p><p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace @spell[cure wounds] with @spell[heat metal], you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p><p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects.

When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell @spell[cure wounds], you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"59\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting Ability</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill.

As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p><p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale.

A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues.

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"54\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"55\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p><p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"56\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Queen of Evil Dragons</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p><p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p><p>Dragon Age Categories</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Category</th><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Size</th><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Age Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Wyrmling</td><td class=\"col-4\">Medium</td><td class=\"col-4\">5 years or less</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Young</td><td class=\"col-4\">Large</td><td class=\"col-4\">6–100 years</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Adult</td><td class=\"col-4\">Huge</td><td class=\"col-4\">101–800 years</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Ancient</td><td class=\"col-4\">Gargantuan</td><td class=\"col-4\">801 years or more</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \" data-source=\"FTD\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"43\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Customizing Dragons</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons\">FTD</span> p33</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>You can customize any dragon's stat block to reflect the dragon's unique character.

Though Qualith can be used to keep records, illithids most often use it to mark portals or other surfaces with warnings or instructions.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful evil","race":"","type":{"value":"aberration","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Underdark","cr":7,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":2900},"source":"MM","class":{},"gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["deep","undercommon"],"custom":"telepathy 120 ft."}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"arc":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"per":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"aVyfPdFKbLCXovy6":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Sadazia","displayName":20,"actorLink":true,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null,"attenuation":0.5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"monks-tokenbar":{"include":"default"},"patrol":{"enablePatrol":false,"enableSpotting":false,"makePatroller":false,"multiPath":false,"patrolPathName":"","pathNodeIndex":"0"},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"chatbubble":""},"environment-interaction":{"environmentToken":false},"core":{"priority":null}},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/MM/Mind Flayer.png","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":120,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"darkvision","color":null,"attenuation":0,"saturation":-1,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1663616027944,"lastModifiedBy":"aVyfPdFKbLCXovy6"}}

They have grown to monstrous proportions and have learned to make the terrain an ally in their hunts.</p><p>Lore</p><p>Natural loners, the spiders of the Tablelands haunt shallow caves, deep valleys, and similar locations that offer cramped confines and twisting passages. The spiders weave webs across these passages. In some instances, they spin their webs over great pits or across chasms.</p><p>Encounters</p><p>Athas's spiders regard other creatures as food, and they establish lairs in territory through which easy prey passes. They prefer areas that see regular travel, steering clear of high-traffic routes to avoid unwanted attention. A spider's lair usually contains three to five webs stretched across its major passages.</p><p>Black Spiders</p><p>Rearing itself up before you is an enormous spider the size of a man with disgusting, oily black skin, mottled with lurid red and purple streaks. Its features are almost humanoid and it regards you with a menacing leer.</p><p>Dark spiders are an intelligent species of subterranean arachnid that lives in highly organized tribal units. Divided among warriors, defilers and queens, they have no natural enemies but often create enemies through their predatory behavior when nesting young. Dark spiders stand six feet in height and weigh 120 pounds, although their queens reach twice that size when mature. The more intelligent among them are able to master humanoid tongues, and some have been known to trade silk to merchant houses in return for warm-blooded slaves.</p><p>Dark spiders prefer to either strike from ambush, using their webbing, or attack with greater numbers and overwhelm their foes. Warbands of warrior spiders are often led by individual defilers or psions, who use their powers to bolster the melee attacks of the warriors. In melee, dark spiders strike with two claws and a poisonous bite. The venom of the queen is particularly potent and is easily capable of killing an adult human. The poison of the other dark spiders is still dangerous but less routinely fatal than that of the queens.</p><p>Info</p><p>Beneath the tyrannical rule of its queens, dark spider society is divided into three tiers, with the warriors being the lowest and most common form of the species.</p>","public":""},"alignment":"unaligned","race":"","type":{"value":"aberration","subtype":"spider","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Desert, Mountain,

However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.</p><p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are.

They have grown to monstrous proportions and have learned to make the terrain an ally in their hunts.</p><p>Lore</p><p>Natural loners, the spiders of the Tablelands haunt shallow caves, deep valleys, and similar locations that offer cramped confines and twisting passages. The spiders weave webs across these passages. In some instances, they spin their webs over great pits or across chasms.</p><p>Encounters</p><p>Athas's spiders regard other creatures as food, and they establish lairs in territory through which easy prey passes. They prefer areas that see regular travel, steering clear of high-traffic routes to avoid unwanted attention. A spider's lair usually contains three to five webs stretched across its major passages.</p><p>Black Spiders</p><p>Rearing itself up before you is an enormous spider the size of a man with disgusting, oily black skin, mottled with lurid red and purple streaks. Its features are almost humanoid and it regards you with a menacing leer.</p><p>Dark spiders are an intelligent species of subterranean arachnid that lives in highly organized tribal units. Divided among warriors, defilers and queens, they have no natural enemies but often create enemies through their predatory behavior when nesting young. Dark spiders stand six feet in height and weigh 120 pounds, although their queens reach twice that size when mature. The more intelligent among them are able to master humanoid tongues, and some have been known to trade silk to merchant houses in return for warm-blooded slaves.</p><p>Dark spiders prefer to either strike from ambush, using their webbing, or attack with greater numbers and overwhelm their foes. Warbands of warrior spiders are often led by individual defilers or psions, who use their powers to bolster the melee attacks of the warriors. In melee, dark spiders strike with two claws and a poisonous bite. The venom of the queen is particularly potent and is easily capable of killing an adult human. The poison of the other dark spiders is still dangerous but less routinely fatal than that of the queens.</p><p>Info</p><p>The defiler caste of dark spider possesses formidable casting abilities and occupies an elite position in dark spider society. Furthermore, one in five defiler spiders also possesses psionic powers. They have access to the same powers listed above for psion spiders, but are CR 8 as a result. Spider Defiler are not using spellbook but weave intricate and complex web where they inscribe occult symbols. The caves where they live are carved with spells and radiate of mystic power. Darks spider defiler are always interested in learning new magical secret and are open to negotiate or trade with creature's that show sign of arcane knowledge.</p>","public":""},"alignment":"unaligned","race":"","type":{"value":"aberration","subtype":"spider","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Desert, Mountain,

curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p><p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.</p><p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p><p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"45\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sworn and Beholden</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.</p><p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"46\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Delvers into Secrets</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p><p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p><p>Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"47\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Warlock</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?</p><p>Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character's adventuring career. Your patron's demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.</p><p>What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron's plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?</p><p>How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron's voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds—messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"48\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions.

Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks.

Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"68\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rogue</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law.

Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre's wrath in an instant-as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"64\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gruesome Gluttons.</span></span> <p>Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry's skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"65\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Greedy Collectors.</span></span> <p>An ogre's eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous \"treasure\" taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre's trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"66\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Legendary Stupidity.</span></span> <p>Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don't understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words-and then being eaten in turn.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"67\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primitive Wanderers.</span></span> <p>Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>An ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"68\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ogre Gangs.</span></span> <p>Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants' complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.</p></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic evil","race":"","type":{"value":"giant","subtype":"","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Arctic, Coastal, Desert, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark","cr":2,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":450},"source":"MM","class":{},"gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"lg","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","giant"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"aVyfPdFKbLCXovy6":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Ogre","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":2,"height":2,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"monks-tokenbar":{"include":"default"},"patrol":{"enablePatrol":false,"enableSpotting":false,"makePatroller":false,"multiPath":false,"patrolPathName":"","pathNodeIndex":"0"},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"chatbubble":""},"environment-interaction":{"environmentToken":false},"core":{}},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/MM/Ogre.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1663501974009,"lastModifiedBy":"aVyfPdFKbLCXovy6"}}

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"14\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"15\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure.

A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano.

She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p><p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.

The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves.

After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"12\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ranging Scavengers.</span></span> <p>Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.</p><p>On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades.

Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"14\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Orc Crossbreeds.</span></span> <p>Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic evil","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"orc","swarm":null,"custom":""},"environment":"Arctic, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark","cr":0.5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":100},"source":"MM","class":{},"gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":"","notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","orc"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":0,"passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"aVyfPdFKbLCXovy6":3},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Orc","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false,"type":null},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"monks-tokenbar":{"include":"default"},"patrol":{"enablePatrol":false,"enableSpotting":false,"makePatroller":false,"multiPath":false,"patrolPathName":"","pathNodeIndex":"0"},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"chatbubble":""},"environment-interaction":{"environmentToken":false},"core":{}},"randomImg":false,"texture":{"src":"assets/srd5e/img/MM/Orc.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":0,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1663501974016,"lastModifiedBy":"aVyfPdFKbLCXovy6"}}

the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.</p><p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' words will be well received.</p><p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"19\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Music and Magic</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>In the worlds of D&amp;D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p><p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"20\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Learning from Experience</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p><p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"21\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Bard</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character's background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There's no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.</p><p>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"22\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span> <p>You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions.

A mummy lord encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 16 (15,000 XP).</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"112\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mummies.</span></span> <p>Raised by dark funerary rituals, a mummy shambles from the shrouded stillness of a time-lost temple or tomb. Having been awoken from its rest, it punishes transgressors with the power of its unholy curse.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"113\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Preserved Wrath.</span></span> <p> The long burial rituals that accompany a mummy's entombment help protect its body from rot. In the embalming process, the newly dead creature's organs are removed and placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with preserving oils, herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corpse is typically wrapped in linen bandages.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>More ephemeral or permanent offenses, such as revealing a secret the mummy wished kept or killing an individual the mummy loved, can't be so easily remedied. In such cases, a mummy might slaughter all the creatures responsible and still not sate its wrath.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"114\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Will of Dark Gods.</span></span> <p> An undead mummy is created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy's linen wrappings are inscribed with necromantic markings before the burial ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual. Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"115\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Punished.</span></span> <p> Once deceased, an individual has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed crimes of treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment, they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed away. Other times, mummies acting as tomb guardians are created from slaves put to death specifically to serve a greater purpose.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"116\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creature of Ritual.</span></span> <p> A mummy obeys the conditions and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it, driven only to punish transgressors. The overwhelming terror that foreshadows a mummy's attack can leave the intended victim paralyzed with fright. In the days following a mummy's touch, a victim's body rots from the outside in, until nothing but dust remains.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"117\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ending a Mummy's Curse.</span></span> <p> Rare magic can undo or dispel the ritual that gave rise to a mummy, allowing it to truly die. More commonly, a mummy can be sent back to its endless rest by undoing the transgression that caused it to rise. A sacred idol might be replaced in its niche, a stolen treasure could be returned to its tomb, or a temple might be purified of despoiling bloodshed.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"118\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Undead Archives.</span></span> <p> Though they seldom bother to do so, mummies can speak.

The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves.

After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.</p><p>On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.</p><p>Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"18\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ranging Scavengers.</span></span> <p> Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"19\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Leadership and Might.</span></span> <p> Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper.

When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"","levels":9,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"subclass":"School of Illusion","damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null,"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1673901315266,"lastModifiedBy":"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN"}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"90\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Born from Death.</span></span> <p>Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn-ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"91\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chained to the Grave.</span></span> <p>Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"92\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Undead Nature.</span></span> <p>Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"93\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Vampire's Lair.</span></span> <p>A vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey.

His brother Sergei came to live with him in Castle Ravenloft, becoming Strahd's adviser and constant companion.</p><p>In his brother, Strahd saw everything he had lost. Sergei was handsome and young, while Strahd had become old and scarred. Resentment colored their relationship, eventually turning into hatred. Strahd's beloved, Tatyana, spurned him for Sergei, whom she pledged to marry.</p><p>In a desperate attempt to win Tatyana's heart, Strahd forged a pact with dark powers that made him immortal. At the wedding of Sergei and Tatyana, he confronted his brother and killed him. Tatyana fled and flung herself from Ravenloft's walls. Strahd's guards, seeing him for a monster, shot him with arrows. But he did not die. He became a vampire-the first vampire, according to many sages.</p><p>In the centuries since his transformation, Strahd's lust for life and youth have only grown.

that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p><p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p><p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p><p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"150\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Cause of Righteousness</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p><p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"151\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beyond the Mundane Life</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p><p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"152\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Paladin</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.</p><p>How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.</p><p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals.

that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p><p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p><p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p><p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"150\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Cause of Righteousness</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p><p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"151\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beyond the Mundane Life</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p><p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"152\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Paladin</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h1> <p>The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.</p><p>How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.</p><p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"","levels":9,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"subclass":"School of Illusion","damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null,"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1673901315266,"lastModifiedBy":"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN"}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"","levels":9,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"subclass":"School of Illusion","damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null,"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1673901315266,"lastModifiedBy":"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN"}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"","levels":9,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"subclass":"School of Illusion","damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null,"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1673901315266,"lastModifiedBy":"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN"}},{"_id":"juEZXAFfMvCQaVM4","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 258","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":10,"units":"minute"},"target":{"value":20,"width":null,"units":"ft","type":"cube"},"range":{"value":120,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"level":3,"school":"ill","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":true},"materials":{"value":"A bit of fleece","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"level","formula":""},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.2","coreVersion":"10.285","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1666030354415,"lastModifiedBy":"OuTQSFtL8HF0sFiN"}},{"_id":"dOruC5u5uo6UidAo","name":"Phantom Steed","type":"spell","img":"icons/magic/nature/wolf-paw-glow-teal-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.spells.wpx42mtoZ5BmXRs1"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range.
